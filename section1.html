        <h1>What Makes Cybersecurity Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) Unique?</h1>
        <p> The table below outlines the distinctive features of Cybersecurity Work-Integrated Learning (WIL) compared to other disciplines. Each aspect is carefully highlighted to show how Cybersecurity WIL provides a unique hands-on learning environment, tailored specifically to address real-world security challenges and ethical dilemmas. Unlike general WIL programs, Cybersecurity WIL immerses students in high-stakes environments, equipping them with experience in using advanced tools and engaging in risk management and incident response.</p>

            <h2>Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Timeline</h2>
            <ul class="timeline">
                <li><strong>2010s</strong>: Rise of Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) and the development of SIEM tools.</li>
                <li><strong>2015</strong>: Integration of AI and Machine learning (ML) in cybersecurity.</li>
                <li><strong>2020</strong>: Focus on cloud security.</li>
                <li><strong>2023</strong>: AI-driven attacks and countermeasures.</li>
            </ul>
			<p>The Cybersecurity Threat Landscape Timeline showcases the rapid evolution of cybersecurity threats, emphasizing the need for up-to-date, hands-on learning experiences that are integral to Work-Integrated Learning (WIL). By mapping out major shifts in cybersecurity from the rise of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) in the 2010s to the emergence of AI-driven attacks in 2023, the timeline highlights the importance of aligning WIL programs with industry trends. This dynamic environment requires students to continuously adapt and develop new skills, making the timeline a visual representation of why practical, real-world exposure is not just beneficial but essential for cybersecurity WIL.</p>
